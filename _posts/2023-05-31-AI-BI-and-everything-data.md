Hello and welcome to "AI, BI, and everything data"!

I'm super excited to launch this blog and share my passion for artificial intelligence (AI), business intelligence (BI), and the ever-growing importance of data in today's digital age. I'm Ioana, a senior BI consultant working for Amesto in Norway, and I've recently made my debut as an international speaker in New Stars of Data #5 and Stockholm Data Saturday. In this blog, we will explore the latest trends and technologies in the world of AI, BI, and data. 

AI is a game-changer - with its ability to mimic human intelligence and automate complex tasks. Here we'll examine real-world examples of how AI is reshaping businesses and societies and tips on how you can make the most of it.

As a BI consultant, I know that BI plays a crucial role in helping organizations gain insight and make data-driven decisions. We'll explore the power of BI (hehe, see what I did here?) and discuss hpow you can get the most out of data, whether you're a data engineer, analyst or citizen developer.

But here's the real superstar of this journey: data! It's the most precious resource a company possesses, right after its talented people. The amount of data generated every day is staggering, and it presents both challenges and opportunities. We'll explore how organizations collect, store, process, and analyze vast amounts of information. 

Looking ahead, the future of AI, BI, and data is brimming with promise. As AI continues to advance, AI ethics and regulations are gaining attention. In the realm of BI, self-service analytics, data democratization, and augmented analytics are impacting businesses, industries, job markets, and society as a whole.

In conclusion, "AI, BI, and everything data" is here to explore what's new and old in the world of AI, BI and data. I invite you to leave comments, ask questions, and share your own experiences.

Thank you for being a part of this exciting adventure!
